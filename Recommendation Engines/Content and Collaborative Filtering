Recommending apparels to user based on Contained Description where the users possess similarity based on content of the products 
using Recommendation Engine Algorithm

We want angle/theta to be almost 0, to have similarity in description of the products
angle = 0, then cos(0) = 1
 
COSINE SIMILARITY overcomes the limitations of the Euclidean distance used in K Means used only for numerical data.

  Import the relevant LIBRARIES
  Read and explore the DATASET
  PREPROCESS the data
    Transform the Text Description feature column to matrix using TfidfVectorizer
  Identify the SIMILARITY of apparels based on description CONTENT using COSINE SIMILARITY/LINEAR KERNEL
    Sort the top N products similar to a given product based on the Cosine Similarity values
  User Defined RECOMMENDATION Method
    To find out most similar products based on the product ID
