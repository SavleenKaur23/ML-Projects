Recognising similar images using K Means Clustering(An Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm) i.e. Recognition of Handwritten Digits

K Means Clustering :
  AIM: To come up with the overall behaviour of the clusters
  Steps:
   S1 Randomly select K datapoints i.e K number of clusters
   S2 Calculate the Euclidean Distance of each datapoint from centroid
          Datapoint closer to a cluster is assigned to that cluster
   S3 Recalculate the centroids by taking the average of datapoints
   S4 Reassign datapoints to new clusters
   S5 Repeat S2 and S3 till the position of records/datapoints from their previous clusters remain same

  Load the relevant LIBRARIES: pandas, numpy,sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy
  Load the DATASET (predefined from Scikit Learn)
  EXPLORE the dataset using keys having data, target ((data: flattened arrays/tensors used for clustering) (target : label associated with flattened array))
  INITIALIZE the K Means Clustering Model for N Clusters
  FIT and PREDICT the model using data from digits dataset
  Explore the Cluster centroids, inertia and optimal number of clusters
  RESHAPE the cluster centres to PLOT the digits as Matrix/Images
  Find and plot the ACCURACY of the model using
      accuracy_score
      Confusion Matrix: To plot how many digits were correctly or incorrectly classified
